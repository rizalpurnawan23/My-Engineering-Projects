# Current Engineering Projects

This directory contains the following list of projects in structural and geotechnical engineering:

## 1. [An Algorithm Development and Computations of Tower Crane Foundation](Engineering-Reports/An_Algorithm_Development_and_Computations_of_Tower_Crane_Foundation.pdf)

This document presents an algorithm development for computing the foundation of tower cranes in Python.
The theoretical framework of the algorithm will be presented in detail by employing mathematical formalism. A
specific computational demonstration will also be presented.

## 2. [Geotechnical Analysis: Soil Stability Under Coal Embankment](Engineering-Reports/Coal_Embankment_Analysis__Portfolio.pdf)

This document presents a geotechnical analysis report of the soil stability under coal embankment on
a certain area in project Smelter Ferronckel Kolaka held by PT. PP (Persero) Tbk. This document is
intended for a portfolio to demonstrate the competency and experience of the author. We do not intend
to share sensitive information in the project, and hence, we do not disclose as much sensitive information
as possible.

## 3. [Structural Analysis: Gas Filling Room Building](Engineering-Reports/Gas_Filling_Room_Portfolio.pdf)

This document contains the structural analysis report of a design of Gas Filling Room Building in Smelter
Ferronickel Kolaka. This document is intended for a portfolio to demonstrate the competency and experience
of the author. We do not intend to share sensitive information in the project, and hence, we do not disclose as
much sensitive information as possible.

## 4. [Structural Analysis: Pipe Rack of Segment Cb1-Cb3](Engineering-Reports/Pipe_Rack_Cb_Portfolio.pdf)

This document contains the structural analysis report of a design of Pipe Rack Structure of segment Cb1-Cb3 in
Smelter Ferronickel Kolaka held by PT. PP (Persero) Tbk. This document is intended for a portfolio to demonstrate the
competency and experience of the author. We do not intend to share sensitive information in the project, and hence, we
do not disclose as much sensitive information as possible.

## 5. [Structural Analysis: Pipe Rack of Segment Cc1-Cc3](Engineering-Reports/Pipe_Rack_Cc_Portfolio.pdf)

This document contains the structural analysis report of a design of Pipe Rack Structure of segment Cc1-Cc3 in
Smelter Ferronickel Kolaka held by PT. PP (Persero) Tbk. This document is intended for a portfolio to demonstrate the
competency and experience of the author. We do not intend to share sensitive information in the project, and hence, we
do not disclose as much sensitive information as possible.

## 6. [Technical Justification: Bearing Capacity of Bored Piles](Engineering-Reports/Technical_Justification__Bearing_Capacity_of_Bored_Piles.pdf)

In this document, we are estimating the capacity bored piles at each depth based on Standard Penetration Test (SPT) data.
The presentation given in this document only outlines the theoretical framework for estimating the capacity
of bored piles but does not explicitly present the computational process to keep the privacy restriction of
the original SPT data. This document is intended for a portfolio and to demonstrate the competency and
experience of the author in the corresponding problem solving.

## 7. [Technical Justification: Settlement Analysis of Transmission Towers](Engineering-Reports/Technical_Justification__Settlement_Transmission_Towers.pdf)

This document covers a presentation related to a technical justification in determining the
total settlements of transmission towers in Smelter Ferronickel Kolaka, a project handled by PT.
PP (Persero) Tbk. This document will not present a detail data used in the project, but rather
demonstrates the methodology and framework for the task. A key innovation employed by the
author is the use of machine learning (ML) algorithm for interpolating the depth factor for immediate settlements.
In addition, this document is intended as a portfolio that demonstrates the
competency and experience of the author in the corresponding problem solving.

## 8. [Warehouse Roof Evaluation for Solar PV Installation](Engineering-Reports/Warehouse_Roof_Evaluation_for_Solar_PV_Installation.pdf)

This work discusses an evalutation of a steel structure warehouse building of a factory subjected to an
additional load for Solar PV installation on its roof structure. The method employed in this project is
a conventional method incorporating structural engineering software SAP2000 for structural modelling with
an evaluation on the structural stability, capacity and servicability. This project is one of my past
freelance projects in structural engineering.
